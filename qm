\section{Quantum Mechanics}
\subsection{Polarisation of light}
We will start our discussion of quantum mechanics in a slightly unusual place: The polarisation of classical light.
We will see that this reproduces a lot of the maths of quantum mechanics in an entirely classical context.

A scalar plane wave (examples for scalar waves are sound waves in a gas) has the general equation
$$p = p_0 \cos(\vec k \cdot \vec r - \omega t + \phi_0).$$
For each value of $\vec k$ there is one type of plane wave (modulo phase and amplitude), hence there is no polarisation.
It is helpful to write the equation in complex notation as
$$p = p_0 e^{\im (\vec k \cdot \vec r - \omega t)},$$
where we implicitly take the real part to get a physical quantity.
Note how this absorbs $\phi_0$ into the now complex $p_0$.

We can now generalise the equation for a vector wave, such as light, as
$$\vec E = \vec E_0 e^{\im (\vec k \cdot \vec r - \omega t)}.$$
Naively we can now form three types of plane waves (one for each component of $\vec E_0$), but there is a further constraint from electrodynamics that states that $\vec k \cdot \vec E = 0$ (in quantum terms this constraint will come from the fact that the photon is massless).
This eliminates the polarisation in the direction of propagation (the ``longitudinal'' mode).

If we pick two vectors $\vec E_1$ and $\vec E_2$ that are equal in magnitude, perpendicular to each other and to $\vec k$, then we can write
$$\vec E_0 = J_1 \vec E_1 + J_2 \vec E_2.$$
The two components of $J$ now form a 2D vector, called the \emph{Jones vector} $\ket{J} = (J_1, J_2)$.
The unconventional notation $\ket{J}$ for a vector is called \emph{Dirac} notation and it's pervasive throughout quantum mechanics (I'm introducing it now to acquaint you with the notation; right now it's really just strange notation for 2D vectors).
A vector $\ket{J}$ is also called a \emph{ket}.
For each ket there is also a \emph{bra} $\bra{J} = ({J_1}^*, {J_2}^*)$.
Note that in matrix notation $\ket{J}$ is a column vector, whereas $\bra{J}$ is a row vector.
We can thus form scalar products
$$\braket{J}{K} = \bra{J} \ket{K} = {J_1}^* K_1 + {J_2}^* K_2,$$
where two adjacent bars can be merged into one.
The operation of converting a ket into a bra is given the symbol ${}^\dagger$.
In matrix notation it's equivalent to transposing, followed by complex conjugation.
From
$$(\braket{J}{K})^\dagger = \braket{K}{J} = (\ket{K})^\dagger (\bra{J})^\dagger$$
we see that $(ab)^\dagger = b^\dagger a^\dagger$.

\begin{question}
What kind of object is $\ket{K} \bra{J}$? (It's not a scalar.)
What are its components?
\hint{Try applying bra or ket vectors to the appropriate side.}
\solution{
$$(\ket{K} \bra{J}) \ket{L} = \ket{K} \braket{J}{L}$$
is a ket and
$$\bra{ L} (\ket{K} \bra{J}) = \braket{L}{K} \bra{J}$$
is a bra.
This implies that $\ket{K} \bra{J}$ is a matrix.
In fact, from the matrix definition as $\ket{K}$ as a row and $\bra{J}$ as a column we see, using matrix multiplication, that
$$\ket{K} \bra{J} = \begin{pmatrix}{K_1}^* J_1 & {K_2}^* J_1\\{K_1}^* J_2 & {K_2}^* J_2\end{pmatrix}.$$
}
\end{question}

Given $\ket{J} = (J_1, J_2)$ we will call $J_1$ the horizontal and $J_2$ the vertical component.
If $\vec E_1$ and $\vec E_2$ have the dimension of $\vec E$, then $\ket{J}$ is dimensionless.
The magnitude squared $\braket{ J}{J }$ is still proportional to intensity, but we can redefine the constant of proportionality arbitrarily.
Here we don't really care about absolute intensity and we will just call $\braket{ J}{J }$ the intensity.


Note how $\ket{J}$ evolves with a factor $e^{\im (\vec k \cdot \vec r - \omega t)}$ and we can thus treat $\ket{J}$ and $e^{\im\phi} \ket{J}$ as equivalent -- they correspond to the same polarisation state, just at a different point in space and time.

\begin{question}
What Jones vector $\ket{\theta}$ corresponds to light linearly polarised at an angle $\theta$ (to the horizontal axis)?
\result{$(\cos \theta, \sin \theta)$.}
\end{question}

Technically the text between $|$ and $\rangle$ is an uninterpreted label and so something like $\ket{\theta+\pi}$ should be considered entirely unrelated to $\ket{\theta}$.
However, insisting on this is cumbersome and we will usually use $\ket{\theta+\pi}$ to mean $(\cos(\theta+\pi), \sin(\theta+\pi))$.
A better notation, perhaps, would be $\ket{\theta=\theta+\pi}$, but the shorter, ambiguous notation is very common in the literature.
We will also define $\ket{\rm H}$ and $\ket{\rm V}$ for the $\theta=0$ and $\theta=\pi/2$ special cases, i.e.\ purely horizontal and purely vertical light.
Here there is no ambiguity because $\rm H$ is just a label and not a variable and $\ket{{\rm H}^2}$, etc., can be unambiguously considered as an entirely unrelated vector.

Now we can define operations on light -- such as polarisation filters (polaroids) -- in terms of $2 \times 2$-matrices.
\begin{question}
Write down the matrix and a bra-ket expression for\\
1. a horizontal polaroid (i.e.\ one that lets through only horizontal light),\\
2. a vertical polaroid,\\
3. a polaroid at an angle $\theta$,\\
4. a rotation by an angle $\theta$,\\
5. a ``quarter-wave plate'' that leaves horizontal light unchanged and delays vertical light by $\pi/2$.
\hint{The first column of the matrix is the effect of the operation on $\ket{\rm H}$ and the second is the effect on $\ket{\rm V}$.}
\hint{To find the bra-ket expressions, consider the effect of $\ket{x} \bra{\rm H}$ on $\ket{\rm H}$ and $\ket{\rm V}$.}
\result{
1. $\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0\\0 & 0\end{pmatrix} = \ket{\rm H} \bra{\rm H}$,\\
2. $\begin{pmatrix}0 & 0\\0 & 1\end{pmatrix} = \ket{\rm V} \bra{\rm V}$,\\
3. $\begin{pmatrix}\cos^2 \theta & \cos \theta \sin \theta\\\cos \theta \sin \theta & \sin^2 \theta\end{pmatrix} = \ket{\theta } \bra{\theta}$,\\
4. $\begin{pmatrix}\cos \theta & -\sin\theta\\\sin \theta & \cos \theta\end{pmatrix} = \ket{\theta}\bra{H} + \ket{\theta+\pi/2}\bra{V}$,\\
5. $\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0\\0 & \im\end{pmatrix} = \ket{\rm H} \bra{\rm H} + \im \ket{\rm V} \bra{\rm V}$.

}
\end{question}

\begin{question}
What's the effect of a quarter-wave plate on light polarised at $\pm \pi/4$ to the horizontal axis?
Calculate the Jones vector for the result and physically interpret it (how does the real $\vec E$ evolve with time?).
\solution{The resulting Jones vector is $(1, \pm \im)/\sqrt{2}$. It corresponds to \emph{circularly polarised} light, i.e.\ $\vec E$ spins around in a circle, in either direction. We call $\ket{\rm LCP} = (1,\im)/\sqrt{2}$ \emph{left-handed circular polarisation} and $\ket{\rm RCP} = (1,-\im)/\sqrt{2}$ as \emph{right-handed circular polarisation} (note: some authors define it the other way around).}
\end{question}

\begin{question}
1. What's the effect of a rotation on LCP and RCP light?\\
2. What about a polaroid at angle $\theta$?
\solution{
1. $(\cos \theta \mp \im \sin \theta, \sin \theta \pm \im \cos \theta)/\sqrt{2} = e^{\mp\im \theta} (1, \pm \im)/\sqrt{2}$ (i.e.\ the state is unaffected).\\
2. $(\cos^2 \theta \pm \im \cos \theta \sin \theta, \cos \theta \sin \theta \pm \im \sin^2 \theta) = e^{\pm \im \theta}/\sqrt{2}~\ket{\theta}$ (i.e.\ linearly polarised light at half the intensity).
}
\end{question}

Note that there is something peculiar about the LCP and RCP states.
We cannot separate them by a linear polaroid -- they seem like ``mixtures'' of all linear polarisation states.
The following question develops some terminoloy to describe this more formally.

\begin{question}
Calculate the effect of a polaroid at angle $\theta$ on an arbitrary state $\ket{J}$, followed by an intensity detector (i.e.\ a device that measures $\braket{ J}{J}$).
Write the result using the dot product of a bra with $\ket{J}$.
\result{$|\braket{ \theta}{J}|^2$.}
\solution{The effect of the polaroid is to yield $(J_1 \cos^2 \theta + J_2 \cos \theta \sin \theta, J_1 \cos \theta \sin \theta + J_2 \sin^2 \theta)$.
The $\braket{ J}{J}$ corresponding to this is
$$|J_1 \cos \theta + J_2 \sin \theta|^2 \cos^2 \theta + |J_1 \cos \theta + J_2 \sin \theta|^2 \sin^2 \theta$$
$$= |J_1 \cos \theta + J_2 \sin \theta|^2 = |\braket{ \theta}{J}|^2.$$
}
\end{question}

Note that this operation amounts to measuring how much intensity is in the $\ket{\theta}$ state.
\begin{question}
What happens if you add the intensity in the $\ket{\theta}$ state to the intensity in the $\ket{\theta+\pi/2}$ state?
\solution{
$$|(\cos \theta, \sin \theta)^\dagger \ket{J}|^2 + |(-\sin \theta, \cos \theta)^\dagger \ket{J}|^2$$
$$= |J_1|^2 \cos^2 \theta + 2 J_1 J_2^* \cos \theta \sin \theta + |J_2|^2 \sin^2 \theta + |J_1|^2 \sin^2 \theta - 2 J_1 J_2^* \cos \theta \sin \theta + |J_2|^2 \cos^2 \theta$$
$$= |J_1|^2 + |J_2|^2 = \braket{J}{J}.$$
The result is the total intensity.
}
\end{question}

\begin{question}
Can you generalise the result from the last question by replacing the $\ket{\theta}$ and $\ket{\theta+\pi/2}$ states with arbitrary states $\ket{K}$ and $\ket{L}$? What properties do they need to have for this to work?
\hint{Try setting $\ket{J} = \ket{K}$ and $\ket{J} = \ket{L}$.}
\solution{
The equation we desire is
$$|\braket{ K}{J}|^2 + |\braket{L}{J}|^2 = \braket{J}{J}.$$
Setting $\ket{J} = \ket{K}$ and $\ket{J} = \ket{L}$ we get
$$|\braket{K}{K}|^2 + |\braket{L}{K}|^2 = \braket{K}{K},\qquad |\braket{L}{L}|^2 + |\braket{K}{L}|^2 = \braket{ L}{L}.$$
You can convince yourself that this works if
$$\braket{ K}{K}  = 1, \quad \braket{L}{L} = 1, \quad \braket{K}{L} = 0.$$
We call $\ket{K}, \ket{L}$ an \emph{orthonormal set} in this case.
}
\end{question}

Note that, given the last question, we can express every $\ket{J}$ as $\alpha \ket{K} + \beta \ket{L}$ and we have $\braket{J}{J} = |\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2$.
\begin{question}
What is $\ket{K} \bra{K} + \ket{L} \bra{L}$?
\solution{
Writing an arbitrary state as $\ket{J} = \alpha \ket{K} + \beta \ket{L}$ and note
$$(\ket{K} \bra{K} + \ket{L} \bra{L}) (\alpha \ket{K} + \beta \ket{L}) = \alpha \ket{K} + \beta \ket{L} = \ket{J},$$
hence $\ket{K} \bra{K} + \ket{L} \bra{L} = 1$.
}
\end{question}

Using our new terminology we can say there is $1/2$ intensity in every $\theta$ state for LCP/RCP light.
The question is now, can we distinguish LCP/RCP states in some other way?

\begin{question}
1. What mathematical expression corresponds to the amount of intensity in the LCP/RCP states?\\
2. Can you find a series of operations that will effect the measurement?\\
3. What about the sum of LCP and RCP intensity?
\solution{
1. $|\braket{\rm LCP}{J}|^2$ and $|\braket{\rm RCP}{J}|^2$.
2. The trick is to convert it to linear light using a quarter-wave plate. After applying the matrix
$$\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0\\0 & \im\end{pmatrix}$$
we get $(1, \pm 1)/\sqrt{2}$, which can be distinguished by measuring in the $\pm \pi/4$ directions.\\
3. $(1,\pm \im)/\sqrt{2}$ form an orthonormal set and so the intensities add to $\langle J\rangle$.
}
\end{question}

\begin{question}
Find a procedure to measure the parameters $a, b, \phi$ for an arbitrary state $(a, b e^{\im \phi})$ (often called elliptical polarisation).
Note that $a > 0$, $b > 0$ and $-\pi < \phi < \pi$.
\solution{
Measuring the horizontal and vertical components gives $a^2$ and $b^2$.
Measuring the LCP component gives
$$I_L = |\braket{\rm LCP}{J}|^2 = |a - \im b e^{\im \phi}|^2/2 = \frac{a^2 + b^2 + 2 a b \sin \phi}{2}$$
and hence $\phi = \arcsin (I_L - (a^2 + b^2)/2)/(ab)$.

}
\end{question}

So far we have always measured the intensity in some state (some Jones vector).
We now want to generalise the notion and we want to ``measure a matrix''.

\begin{question}
Write the expression $|\langle K|J\rangle|^2$ in terms of a matrix and $|J\rangle$.
\hint{Remember $|a|^2 = a a^* = a a^\dagger$.}
\result{$\bra{J} M \ket{J}$, where $M=\ket{K} \bra{K}$.}
\end{question}

\begin{question}
(optional)
Show that an arbitrary matrix $M$ can be written as a sum of terms of the form $\alpha \ket{K} \bra{K}$.
\solution{
Suppose that $M = \left(\begin{smallmatrix}M_1 & M_2\\M_3 & M_4\end{smallmatrix}\right)$.
Note that
$$\ket{\rm LCP} \bra{\rm LCP} = \frac{1}{2} \begin{pmatrix}1 & \im\\-\im & 1\end{pmatrix},\quad \ket{\pi/4} \bra{\pi/4} = \frac{1}{2} \begin{pmatrix}1 & 1\\1 & 1\end{pmatrix},$$
and hence
$$(M_2 + M_3) \ket{\pi/4} \bra{\pi/4} + (M_2 - M_3) (-\im) \ket{\rm LCP} \bra{\rm LCP} = \begin{pmatrix}M_2 (1 - \im) + M_3 (1 + \im) & M_2\\M_3 & M_2 (1 - \im) + M_3 (1 + \im)\end{pmatrix}.$$
We can now easily fix the diagonal elements to find that
$$M = (M_2 + M_3) \ket{\pi/4} \bra{\pi/4} + (M_2 - M_3) (-\im) \ket{\rm LCP} \bra{\rm LCP}$$
$$+ (M_1 - M_2 (1 - \im) - M_3 (1 + \im)) \ket{\rm H} \bra{\rm H} + (M_4 - M_2 (1 - \im) - M_3 (1+\im)) \ket{\rm V} \bra{\rm V}.$$
}
\end{question}

\begin{question}
Define the ``measured value'' $\mathcal{M}(M)$ for a matrix $M$ in a state $|J\rangle$, both as a mathematical expression and as a procedure to determine its value in practice.
Since total intensity is arbitrary, define it so that it is independent of $\braket{J}{J}$.
\result{$\bra{J} M \ket{J} / \braket{J}{J}$.}
\solution{The previous question showed that we can write $M = \sum \alpha_i \ket{i} \bra{i}$.
We can define the measured value of $M$ now as follows.
Measure the intensity for each $\ket{i}$.
Multiply the result of each by $\alpha_i$ and sum them to get a final value $v$.
Divide that value by $\braket{J}{J}$ to remove the dependence on total intensity.
The mathematical expression for this value is
$$v = \sum_i \alpha_i |\braket{i}{J}|^2 = \sum_i \alpha_i \bra{J} \ket{i} \bra{i} \ket{J} = \bra{J} M \ket{J}.$$
and hence the measured value is $\bra{J} M \ket{J}/\braket{J}{J}.$
}
\end{question}

I admit, this notion of a measured value of a matrix is rather esoteric and artificial, but we will soon find this notion to be very useful when developing quantum theory.
As bizarre as it is, always remember that we can define it precisely in terms of physical measurements.

\begin{question}
Find the measured value of a rotation matrix $R_\phi$ for the states $\ket{\theta}$, $\ket{\rm LCP}$ and $\ket{\rm RCP}$.
\solution{
Note that all three states are ``normalised'' ($\braket{J}{J} = 1$).
We know that
$$R_\phi \ket{\theta} = \ket{\theta+\phi}, \quad R_\phi \ket{\rm LCP} = e^{-\im \phi} \ket{\rm LCP}, \quad R_\phi \ket{\rm RCP} = e^{\im \phi}$$
and hence the measured values are $\cos \phi$, $e^{-\im \phi}$ and $e^{\im \phi}$, respectively.
}
\end{question}

\begin{question}
1. How do the measured values of $M$ and $M^\dagger$ relate?\\
2. Under what condition are the measured values of $M$ always real?
\solution{
1. They are complex conjugate, as follows from
$$\left(\sum \alpha_i \ket{i} \bra{i}\right)^\dagger = \sum {\alpha_i}^* \ket{i} \bra{i}.$$
2. $M = M^\dagger$.
}
\end{question}

\subsection{Unpolarisation of light}
The formalism from the last section can explain polarised light, but most everyday light is (at least to some extent) unpolarised.
Unpolarised light has the property that measuring the intensity in \emph{any} normalised state $\ket{K}$ gives the same answer.

\begin{question}
We saw earlier that the intensity of $\ket{\rm LCP}$ in any $\ket{\theta}$ state is $1/2$. What then is the difference between $\ket{\rm LCP}$ and unpolarised light?
\solution{
Unpolarised light has the same intensity in \emph{both} LCP and RCP states, but $\ket{\rm LCP}$ obviously does not.
}
\end{question}

\begin{question}
Show that unpolarised light (of non-zero intensity) cannot be described by \emph{any} ket $\ket{J}$.
\solution{
Write $\ket{J} = \alpha \ket{K} + \beta \ket{L}$ for two orthonormal states $\ket{K}$ and $\ket{L}$ and define $\ket{H} = -\beta \ket{K} + \alpha \ket{L}$.
If $\ket{J}$ is unpolarised, then $\braket{H}{J} = \braket{J}{J} \ne 0$.
But $\braket{H}{J} = -\beta \alpha + \beta\alpha = 0$.
Hence $\ket{J}$ cannot be unpolarised.
}
\end{question}

One trick that correctly describes unpolarised light is to use the ket $\ket{u_\delta} = (1, e^{\im \delta})/\sqrt{2}$ with \emph{random} $\delta$.
This corresponds to elliptically polarised light of random ``circliness'' ($\delta=0,\pi$ is linearly polarised, $\delta=\pm\pi/2$ is circularly polarised).
Note that when we measure the intensity in any ket $\ket{K}$, $\ket{K}$ must be independent of $\delta$ and we must average over all values of $\delta$ in the end.

\begin{question}
Show that the intensity of $\ket{u_\delta}$ in any normalised ket $\ket{K}$ is $1/2$.
\solution{
$$|\braket{K}{u_\delta}|^2 = \frac{1}{2} |K_1 + K_2 e^{\im \delta}|^2 = \frac{1}{2} (|K_1|^2 + |K_2|^2 + 2 K_1 K_2 \cos \delta) = \frac{1}{2} + K_1 K_2 \cos \delta,$$
after averaging the $\cos \delta$ disappears and we're left with $1/2$.
}
\end{question}

\begin{question}
What is the effect of (a) a linear polariser, (b) a quarter-wave plate and (c) a rotation on unpolarised light?\\
\solution{(a) $\ket{\theta} \braket{\theta}{u_\delta} = (\cos \theta + e^{\im \delta} \sin \theta)/\sqrt{2}~\ket{\theta}$.
Note that $\left|\cos \theta + e^{\im \delta} \sin \theta\right| = \cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta + 2 \cos \delta \cos \theta \sin \theta = 1 + \cos \delta \sin(2\theta)$.
We thus get linearly polarised light with an average intensity of $1/2$.\\
(b) $(1, \im e^{\im \delta})/\sqrt{2}$ is also unpolarised light, since we can redefine $\delta \to \delta - \pi/2$.\\
(c) Intuitively, the result is still unpolarised light. Mathematically it's a bit trickier since
$$R_\theta |u_\delta\rangle = (\cos \theta + \sin \theta e^{\im \delta}, -\sin \theta + \cos \theta e^{\im \delta}).$$
It is not at all obvious that the result is unpolarised.
If you are feeling very keen, you can go back to the defining property and take dot products with arbitrary vectors to show that the answer is $1/2$ after averaging.
}
\end{question}

We saw that in the last question (especially (c)) that it's very difficult to manipulate unpolarised light using the expression $(1,e^{\im \delta})/\sqrt{2}$.
We found a lot of different ways to express the same unpolarised state in terms of $\delta$, which makes it tricky to show that two states are actually physically the same.
We would thus like a different formalism that doesn't use $\delta$.
The key insight is to take the expression for the intensity $\mathcal{A}\left(|\braket{K}{u_\delta}|^2\right)$, where $\mathcal{A}$ denotes averaging over $\delta$.
We can then write it as
$$\mathcal{A}\left(\bra{K} \ket{u_\delta} \bra{u_\delta} \ket{K}\right) = \bra{K} \mathcal{A}\left(\ket{u_\delta} \bra{u_\delta}\right) \ket{K} = \bra{K} \varrho \ket{K},$$
where the object
$$\varrho = \mathcal{A}\left(\ket{u_\delta} \bra{u_\delta}\right)$$
does not depend on $\delta$ (since the dependence is averaged out); yet since the above expression is general, it contains enough information to predict the result to \emph{any} intensity measurement.
$\varrho$ is called a \emph{density matrix}.
We can generalise the definition to arbitrary polarised and even to mixed polarised/unpolarised light, with the general formula $\varrho = \mathcal{A}\left(\ket{K_\delta} \bra{K_\delta}\right)$, where $\ket{K_\delta}$ is an arbitrary state that may or may not depend on $\delta$.
We will call a general $\varrho$ state a \emph{mixed state} and a state with no unpolarised component (i.e.\ can be written with $\ket{K_\delta}$ independent of $\delta$) a \emph{pure state}.

\begin{question}
Calculate $\varrho$ for\\
(a) unpolarised light,\\
(b) horizontally polarised light,\\
(c) vertically polarised light,\\
(d) light that is polarised in the $\theta$ direction,\\
(e) LCP/RCP light.
\result{
(a) $1/2 = \begin{pmatrix}1/2 & 0\\0 & 1/2\end{pmatrix}$\\
(b) $\ket{\rm H} \bra{\rm H} = \begin{pmatrix}1 & 0\\0 & 0\end{pmatrix}$\\
(c) $\ket{\rm V} \bra{\rm V} = \begin{pmatrix}0 & 0\\0 & 1\end{pmatrix}$\\
(d) $\ket{\theta} \bra{\theta} = \begin{pmatrix}\cos^2 \theta & \cos \theta \sin \theta\\\cos \theta \sin \theta & \sin^2 \theta\end{pmatrix}$\\
(e) $\ket{\rm L/RCP} \bra{\rm L/RCP} = \begin{pmatrix}1/2 & \pm\im/2\\\mp\im/2 & 1/2\end{pmatrix}$
}
\end{question}

\begin{question}
(a) Light from two uncorrelated sources $\varrho_1$ and $\varrho_2$ is mixed. What is the density matrix of the resulting light?\\
(b) If the two sources emit light in two orthonormal pure states, what is the result?
\hint{(a) Write $\varrho_1$ in terms of $\ket{K_\delta}$ and $\varrho_2$ in terms of $\ket{L_\varepsilon}$ and add the states $\ket{K_\delta}$ and $\ket{L_\varepsilon}$ states. Think about the phase relationship between $\ket{K_\delta}$ and $\ket{L_\varepsilon}$ (even if they are pure states).}
\solution{
(a) The total state is
$$\varrho = \mathcal{A}((\ket{K_\delta} + \ket{L_\varepsilon}) (\bra{K_\delta} + \bra{L_\varepsilon})) = \mathcal{A}(\ket{K_\delta} \bra{K_\delta}) + \mathcal{A}(\ket{L_\varepsilon} \bra{L_\varepsilon}) + 2 \operatorname{Re} \mathcal{A}(\ket{L_\varepsilon} \bra{K_\delta}).$$
Since the two sources are uncorrelated, there is a random phase factor between the two and so $\mathcal{A}(\ket{L_\varepsilon} \bra{K_\delta}) = 0$.
Hence $\varrho = \varrho_1 + \varrho_2$.

(b) We have $\varrho = \ket{K} \bra{K} + \ket{L} \bra{L} = 1,$
hence the result is unpolarised.
}
\end{question}

\begin{question}
Find an expression for the density matrix of light which has been manipulated with a matrix $M$ and originally had a density matrix $\varrho$.
\result{$M \varrho M^\dagger$.}
\solution{We have $\ket{K} \to M \ket{K}$ and $\bra{K} \to \bra{K} M^\dagger$.
Hence
$$\varrho = \mathcal{A}\left(\ket{J} \bra{J}\right) \to \mathcal{A}\left(M \ket{J} \bra{J} M^\dagger\right) = M \varrho M^\dagger.$$
}
\end{question}

\begin{question}
Now using $\varrho$: What is the effect on the density matrix of originally unpolarised light that passed through (a) a linear polariser, (b) a quarter-wave plate and (c) a rotation?
\solution{
Note that in all cases $\rho = 1/2$ and so $M^\dagger \rho M = M^\dagger M / 2$.\\
(a) $\frac{1}{2} \ket{\theta} \bra{\theta} \ket{\theta} \bra{\theta} = \frac{1}{2} \ket{\theta} \bra{\theta}$.\\
(b) $\frac{1}{2} \begin{pmatrix}1 & 0\\0 & \im (-\im)\end{pmatrix} = \frac{1}{2}$.\\
(c) $\frac{1}{2} R_{-\theta} R_\theta = \frac{1}{2}$.
}
\end{question}

\begin{question}
The trace $\tr(M)$ is defined to be linear in $M$ and to obey $\tr(\ket{A} \bra{B}) = \braket{B}{A}$.
Show that $\tr(\ket{A} \bra{B} C) = \bra{B} C \ket{A}$ and $\tr(C D) = \tr(D C)$ for two matrices $C$ and $D$.
\hint{Remember that $M = \sum_i \alpha_i \ket{i} \bra{i}$.}
\solution{
Write $C = \sum_i \gamma_i \ket{i} \bra{i}$ and note that
$$\tr(\ket{A} \bra{B} C) = \sum_i \gamma_i \tr(\ket{A} \bra{B} \ket{i} \bra{i}) = \sum_i \gamma_i \braket{B}{i} \tr(\ket{A} \bra{i}) = \sum_i \gamma_i \braket{B}{i} \braket{i}{A} = \bra{B} C \ket{A}.$$
With $D = \sum_j \delta_j \ket{j} \bra{j}$ we have
$$\tr(CD) = \sum_{i,j} \gamma_i \delta_j \tr(\ket{i} \braket{i}{j} \bra{j}) = \sum_{i,j} \gamma_i \delta_j \tr(\ket{j} \bra{i}) \tr(\ket{i} \bra{j}),$$
the result is symmetric in $i$ and $j$ and so equal to $\tr(DC)$.

\begin{question}
Find an expression for the measured value of a matrix $M$ in a mixed state $\varrho$.
Express the result using the trace.
\hint{Remember the definition of measured value in terms of physical measurements.}
\solution{
Write $M = \sum_i \alpha_i \ket{i} \bra{i}$.
The measured value is defined as
$$\mathcal{M} = \frac{1}{I_0} \sum_i \alpha_i \times \mbox{intensity in the $\ket{i}$ state},$$
where $I_0$ is the total intensity.
For a mixed state we have the intensity in the $\ket{i}$ state as $\bra{i} \varrho \ket{i}$ 
$$\frac{1}{I_0} \sum_i \alpha_i \bra{i} \varrho \ket{i} = \frac{1}{I_0} \sum_i \alpha_i \tr(\ket{i} \bra{i} \varrho) = \frac{1}{I_0} \tr\left(\left(\sum_i \alpha_i \ket{i} \bra{i}\right) \varrho\right) = \frac{\tr(\rho M)}{I_0}.$$
To find $I_0$ note that we want the measured value of $1$ to be $1$ and so $I_0 = \tr(\rho)$. Hence
$$\mathcal{M}(M) = \frac{\tr(\rho M)}{\tr(\rho)}.$$

\begin{question}
Show that\\
1. $\tr(\varrho) \ge 0$,\\
2. $\varrho = \varrho^\dagger$,\\
3. $|\braket{A}{B}|^2 \le \braket{A}{A} \braket{B}{B},$\\
4. $\tr(\varrho^2) \le (\tr(\varrho))^2$ (with equality for polarised light).
\hint{3. Find a vector $\ket{C}$ so that $\ket{A} \bra{A} + \ket{C} \bra{C} = \braket{A}{A}$ (remember we are in 2D). Then manipulate that equation by applying bras and kets.}
\solution{
1. $\tr(\varrho) = \mathcal{A}(\tr(\ket{K_\delta}\bra{K_\delta})) = \mathcal{A}(\braket{K_\delta}{K_\delta}) \ge 0$, since $\braket{K_\delta}{K_\delta} \ge 0$.\\
2. $\varrho^\dagger = \mathcal{A}((\ket {K_\delta} \bra{K_\delta})^\dagger) = \mathcal{A}(\ket{K_\delta} \bra{K_\delta}) = \varrho$.\\
3. If $\ket{C}$ is orthogonal to $\ket{A}$ and $\braket{C}{C} = \braket{A}{A}$ then $\ket{A} \bra{A} + \ket{C} \bra{C} = \braket{A}{A}$ and
$$\braket{A}{A} \braket{B}{B} = \bra{B} \braket{A}{A} \ket{B} = \braket{B}{A} \braket{A}{B} + \braket{B}{C} \braket{C}{B} \ge |\braket{B}{A}|^2.$$
4. We can introduce a second ``$\delta$'' called $\varepsilon$ and use it to write $\varrho^2$ using a single average over both variables as
$$\varrho^2 = \mathcal{A}(\ket{K_\delta} \braket{K_\delta}{K_\varepsilon} \bra{K_\varepsilon}).$$
It follows that
$$\tr(\varrho^2) = \mathcal{A}(\tr(\ket{K_\delta} \braket{K_\delta}{K_\varepsilon} \bra{K_\varepsilon})) = \mathcal{A} (\braket{K_\varepsilon}{K_\delta} \braket{K_\delta}{K_\varepsilon}).$$
Now we can use the result from 3.\ to show that
$$\tr(\rho^2) \le \mathcal{A}(\braket{K_\varepsilon}{K_\varepsilon}) \mathcal{A}(\braket{K_\delta}{K_\delta}) = (\tr(\rho))^2$$
(note that the average ``splits'' like that because each expression averages over a different variable).
